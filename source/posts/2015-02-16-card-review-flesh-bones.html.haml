title: "Card Review: Flesh +&nbsp;Bones"
---

:markdown
  [Flesh + Bones](http://dualoriginals.com/products/cards) is the most recent
  deck of playing cards I have received for my collection, so I figured I
  would review this one first. This is a deck hand-illustrated by
  [Dual Originals](http://dualoriginals.com/) for
  [DeckStarter](https://deckstarter.com/), and I was a&nbsp;backer.

  Admittedly, I was very frustrated because my order was really late. But
  after some back-and-forth over support and social media, DeckStarter made it
  right with me. I can be a little impatient for things I've paid for, but
  once I received the deck I was very happy and it was worth the&nbsp;wait.

  ## The Box

    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/box-2/tablet.jpg", alt: "Box Photo 2"

:markdown
  I love the design used for box. It is minimalist &mdash; just black and
  white. It reminds me of the Bristol Board I used to print on a lot in
  art&nbsp;school.

  ## Card Backs

  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/back/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/back/tablet.jpg", alt: "Back"

:markdown
  Most decks I have sport beautiful backs and have boring fronts. While I
  think the backs of these cards are very nice, they are less interesting than
  the fronts, which you&rsquo;ll see&nbsp;soon.

  ## Number Cards

%p
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/numbers/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/numbers/tablet.jpg", alt: "Numbers"

:markdown
  The front of the number cards are smaller numbers and pips, a slight
  departure from the standard style. I like the&nbsp;simplicity.

  ## The Aces

%p
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/aces/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/aces/tablet.jpg", alt: "Aces"

:markdown
  Usually only the Ace of Spades has a fancy design. I love that all four aces
  get a nice&nbsp;illustration.

  ## The Face Cards

    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/jacks/tablet.jpg", alt: "Jacks"
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/queens/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/queens/tablet.jpg", alt: "Queens"
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/kings/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/kings/tablet.jpg", alt: "Kings"

:markdown
  I love these face cards. Instead of typical royal humans in fancy clothes,
  we get a range of monsters, including mermaids, dragons, unicorns,&nbsp;etc.

  ## Jokers <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Other Cards

%p
  = link_to "/assets/img/journal/cards/flesh-bones/extras/fullsize.jpg", target: "_blank" do
    = image_tag "journal/cards/flesh-bones/extras/tablet.jpg", alt: "Extras"

:markdown
  The Jokers are stunning. I like the contrast between the two. One card is
  heavy with a skeleton with long hair filling most of the card. The other
  joker is stark and clean with the butterfly (or moth?) in the&nbsp;middle.

  Finally, the deck also comes with information cards for both
  [Art of Play](http://www.artofplay.com/) and Dual&nbsp;Originals.
